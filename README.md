## How to generate a proposal table

### Step 1 — Export your estimate as JSON
1. Open your [AWS Pricing Calculator](https://calculator.aws) estimate
2. Click **Export** → **JSON**
3. Rename the file to your customer name (e.g. `Ayris Logic.json`)

### Step 2 — Drop the file into Kiro
Drag the JSON file into the **`upload json file here`** folder in Kiro's file explorer.

Kiro will automatically detect it and start generating the table.

### Step 3 — Copy into Google Doc
1. Kiro opens the table in your browser
2. Select all → Copy → Paste into your Google Doc
3. Follow the two clean-up steps shown in the yellow box on the page
